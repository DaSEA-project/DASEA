== DaSEA - **Da**ta for **S**oftware **E**cosystem **A**nalysis

DaSEA is the name of a dataset of software dependency networks of various ecosystems.
In this repository is the code and documentation of the `dasea` tool, which mines, creates, and releases new versions of the dataset

The latest versions of the dataset are available from https://dependulum.github.io/DASEA/[DASEA].


=== Setup Project Locally

Every ecosystem that can be mined remotely, i.e., by sending requests to web-APIs, text mining in cloned remote repositories, etc., can be mined directly on a Linux/Unix host.
